Variant A — Ownership Emphasis: Open with scope of responsibility and end-to-end ownership language. Lead with what the candidate ran, not what they did.

Variant B — Client Impact Emphasis: Open with client-facing outcomes and relationship language. Lead with who the candidate served and what changed for them.

Variant C — Cross-Functional Emphasis: Open with coordination scope and stakeholder complexity. Lead with the breadth of teams and parties the candidate operated across.

Each variant: 3 sentences maximum. No variant should sound like the others. Every sentence must be traceable to actual resume content. Third person, institutional voice.

Each question must: (1) directly probe a specific gap or risk from the analysis — not a generic interview question, (2) be written exactly as a hiring manager would ask it in a real interview, first person, direct, (3) include a "why_asking" note in one sentence tied to the specific gap it probes, (4) include a "signal_angle" coaching note in one sentence telling the user what their answer must demonstrate to pass this question.

Each variant must: signal the specific role they are targeting, use language a recruiter scanning for this role type would pattern-match on, be under 220 characters, and take a meaningfully different strategic angle:

The summary must: open with a hook that names their specific professional identity in one sentence, spend the middle section connecting their cross-environment experience to the target role's core requirements, and close with a forward-looking statement about what kind of role and organization they're seeking.

VOICE: ${toneVoice}

Write exactly 5 paragraphs separated by blank lines. ~250 words total.

P1: Lead with your most concrete, relevant credential for THIS role. A number, a scope, a system you ran. Then say why you're applying. No philosophy, no observations about the industry — just: here's what I do, here's why this role.

P2: Your hardest operational proof. Specific volumes, outcomes, problems solved. Start at least one sentence with the result or the work, not "I". Show the hiring manager you've done hard, relevant work.

P3: People and judgment proof. Who you worked with, what you decided, what required navigating complexity. Different evidence from P2.

P4: Name what you haven't done (the gap) in one clause, then immediately pivot to what makes you ready anyway. No apology. No defensiveness. Just honesty and forward motion.

P5: End with what you'll do in this role, not what you hope for. Make the reader want the interview. No "thank you for considering," no "I look forward to."

HARD RULES:
- Max 1 sentence per paragraph starts with "I"
- Do NOT open P1 with a general observation, philosophy, or "Customer experience lives in..." or "The fundamentals are..." — open with YOU doing WORK
- No "I am writing to apply/express" or "I am excited/eager"
- No explaining WHY your experience transfers — just USE IT as proof
- ZERO fabrication
- BANNED phrases: "positioned to," "passionate about," "eager to," "proven ability," "results-driven," "strong foundation," "translates to," "mirrors," "taught me," "demonstrates," "aligns with," "prepared me," "transferable," "equipped me," "the fundamentals are," "customer experience lives," "I learned that," "this represents," "what matters is," "it's not about X it's about Y," "natural evolution," "this environment developed"
