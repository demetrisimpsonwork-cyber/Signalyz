Variant B — Client Impact Emphasis: Open with client-facing outcomes and relationship language. Lead with who the candidate served and what changed for them.

Variant C — Cross-Functional Emphasis: Open with coordination scope and stakeholder complexity. Lead with the breadth of teams and parties the candidate operated across.

Each variant: 3 sentences maximum. No variant should sound like the others. Every sentence must be traceable to actual resume content. Third person, institutional voice.

- Use systems-thinking language throughout: "designed," "scaled," "operationalized," "built the process that."

- Reference process, infrastructure, and repeatability — not just individual actions.
- Paragraphs can be longer; each sentence should build on the prior one logically.
- Close with a single sentence connecting your operational systems to what the company needs to build next. Format: "I am ready to bring [specific capability] to ${companyName} [specific outcome]."
- NEVER use "positioned to," "I am positioned," or "positions me to."`
          : tone === "direct"
          ? `TONE — DIRECT:
- Fewest words possible. Every sentence is declarative. No subordinate clauses unless necessary.
- No throat-clearing ("In my experience," "I believe that," "Having worked in"). Start sentences with subjects and verbs.
- Paragraphs should be 2-3 sentences maximum.
- Close with exactly one sentence stating intent. Format: "I am ready to bring [specific thing] to ${companyName} from day one."
- NEVER use "positioned to," "I am positioned," or "positions me to."`

- Short paragraphs. Authority-first framing: state the claim, then the evidence.
- No hedging words anywhere: no "I believe," "I feel," "I think," "perhaps," "likely."
- Every sentence projects certainty. Use present tense where possible.
- Close with a direct statement of intent. Format: "I am ready to bring [specific discipline/capability] to ${companyName} from day one."

HARD RULES:
- NEVER use the phrases "positioned to," "I am positioned," "positions me to," or any variation of "position" as a verb describing the candidate.
- NEVER start paragraph 3 with "Your organization requires," "Your organization needs," "Your team needs," or any sentence that echoes back the job description requirements.
- Maximum 250 words total. Exactly 3 paragraphs. First person as the candidate.

Structure:

Paragraph 1 — Open with a declarative statement of professional identity naming the strongest transferable signal for this specific role. Do not open with "I am writing to apply," "I am excited," or "I am thrilled." Open with what the candidate brings — present tense, first person, specific.

Paragraph 2 — Acknowledge the candidate's background gap honestly in the first sentence (e.g., if they come from a different industry, say so directly: "My background is in [X], not [Y]."). Then immediately reframe it: explain specifically what experience transfers and why it is actually an advantage for this role. Use a concrete example from the resume. Do not pretend the gap doesn't exist. Do not avoid naming it.

Paragraph 3 — Do NOT echo the job description. Do NOT start with what the organization needs. Instead, state what the candidate will do in this role based on their specific operational strengths. Reference a specific capability or system they have built/managed. Close with one direct sentence of intent — no "Thank you for your consideration," no "I look forward to hearing from you."
